In the ended summer, millions of dollars change hands, as the world’s top clubs were chasing players for the coming seasons. Though is a major factor, a soccer player’s performance is not the only thing matters when measuring his transit fee. 

A player’s transit fee directly reflects his relative value to a team, said Rodney Fort, a sports management professor at the University of Michigan. A soccer team that wants to buy a player needs to pay compensation for the player’s current club. A transit fee is negotiated by the two companies, which includes the payment for the team and the salary for the player. The original contract between the player and the club is then terminated, and a new one will be written with the new club. When involving more than one buyers for a player, the transit fee is usually lifted because the player will likely move to the team that pays him a higher salary, said Fort.

The former Real Madrid attacker, 33-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Juventus with 88 million pounds (US$117 million) transit fee this summer, compared with the 17.16 million pounds of the average players’ transit fee during season 2017-2018. As one of the best players in the world, Ronaldo was recognized by FIFA as the player of the year for the fifth time in his career in 2017 and helped Real Madrid complete its third consecutive Champions League triumph. The Portuguese player is the top scorer in Champions League’s history with 120 goals in total, according to the Union of European Football Associations. 


“In soccer, winning is everything. The value of a player is the success,” said Stefan Szymanski, the sports management and economics professor at the University of Michigan.  

However, Szymanski noticed the amount paid for buying Ronaldo would be higher five years ago because he is not at the best age. According to the data from SoccerNews.com, players around 25-year-old have the highest transfer fee. Teams only pay a hefty price for a player who has proven ability and who has years left in his career, Szymanski explained.

Szymanski said, even for a player with proved ability, a team won’t pay a high transit fee if his career’s remaining time is short. However, the good fitness record and reputation for not prone to injury preserved Ronaldo’s value, because it’s likely for him to perform at his highest level for another three or four years, Szymanski said.

For the young players who have less competition experience, the soccer clubs usually have less passion for pursuing because the young talents’ ability isn’t proved, and the performance might not be consistent if it's not declining. But a player’s capability usually become clear at the age of 25, and the clubs would be more likely to pay a large transit fee, said Szymanski.

However, Kylian Mbappé, the 19-year-old French forward, transferred to Paris Saint-Germain July with a 135 million Euros transit fee making him the second most expensive soccer player in history. Rewarded with the Best Young Player at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Mbappé’s potential convinced the market that he would become a big star in the future, said Szymanski. Even no one can guarantee fledging players’ performance after 25-year-old, the big clubs occasionally gamble on young ones with a hope that their ability will be steady and they can be leading players in the world, he said.

The player’s position on the field is also a determiner for his transit fee. The attackers that are at the most forward positions in a team always have a higher transit fee. According to the data from SoccerNews.com, average transit fee for attackers in season 2017-2018 was 30.5 percent higher than for defenders.

“The scarcest talent in soccer is scoring goals. That's the thing that wins you the game,” said Szymanski. “The best players are always going into the attacking roles.”

Szymanski said that in many cases, a forward player would be deployed backward playing midfielder or defender when he starts aging and his speed starts to decline. 

“Because you don’t need to be that skillful in those positions,” said Szymanski. 

However, a transit fee could be affected by off-field factors that are unrelated to a player’s soccer skills. Fort said the transit fee is always related to how well the players can speak the domestic language and the country that the players come from because the clubs care about how their fans like their players. Moreover, the players that have more exposure and have a good image in communities possess a higher transit fee, because they’re more likely to bring sponsorship contracts for the team from advertisers and businesses. 

“You want to entertain all of the ways both on the field and off the field, all the ways that the player helps generate revenue for your team,” said Fort. “Wherever Messi goes, there’s gonna be a nice big fat contract for the team.”

Many times, a player’s transit fee is dictated by the club to eliminate anybody who has interest on the player, with a buyout clause that surpasses the actual value of a player, said David Herman, the prime minister of public relations at Manchester United USA supporters club. Lionel Messi, the Argentina superstar’s buyout clause with Barcelona in 2017 was set at $835 million, which makes other clubs unlikely afford him.

The big clubs are usually forced to pay more for a player, said Herman. Deals between clubs, such as Manchester United, one of the most famous clubs in Premier League, tend to drive up from the player’s actual value because big teams are usually affluent and can afford a higher price. But a deal like it not always can be closed, said Herman. Harry Maguire, a Leicester defender who was targeted by Manchester United, was involved in the summer transfer market. Based on his terrific performance at the finished World Cup, the transit fee for Maguire was set to 75 million pounds, which could be the highest price for purchasing a defender. However, Herman said Maguire is not worth the price and the deal went nowhere.

The global transfer fee for players increases around ten-fold since 1995, with a total fee of more than $6 billion in 2017, according to Andrew Orsatti, the spokesman for Football’s International Players’ Union. In the past ten years, even amid the effects of a global recession, transit fee has gone from $2.9 billion to $6.37 billion approximately, according to Orsatti. 

Orsatti added the broadcast rights leads the raise. Revenue from the sale of media rights to the Premier League, which is the top senders on the transfer market, went from less than 500 million pounds from 2004 to 2007, to around 2.25 billion pounds for 2016 to 2019. 

“Soccer’s popularity has been growing continuously for 100 years. As a result, more money comes into the game, and therefore more money gets spent in competing to attract the best players,” said Szymanski.
