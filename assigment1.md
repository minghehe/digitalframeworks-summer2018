EA sports is the sports division of Electronic Arts, a company that specializes in producing videogames. One of the most successful games of EA sports is FIFA Soccer. In order to approximate the game to the real world, the company put huge amounts of data and statistics from the actual players during the season into their engine. 

Since 2010 World Cup they use FIFA Soccer to predict the winner of the tournament. The results are 100 percent accurate so far (2010 and 2014). For this World Cup, the team FIFA Soccer bets on is France which heads to the final already. How does the company use the data get the precise result?

When the transfer window opens at end of each season, we see several millionaire transactions of soccer players from clubs. Some transfers are worthwhile, when the player contributes great achievements to their teams. While others are not, and the deals are quickly undone in few months. Then, the question arises: how to estimate the value of a player? Is Messi really worth $273 million? Cristiano Ronaldo left Real Madrid and going to Juventus, with a transfer fee of $117.5 million and additional payments of $14.1 million to Ronaldo’s previous clubs. Which factors influence in a player’s value?

### Story critique

#### Clarity and accuracy

* 4
  * The central insight of this story is the constant rise of the transfer fees of soccer players along the years. The headline summarizes well the main point and, along with the story, the matter is discussed with further details.
* 5
  * In this story, the data was well organized in two graphs: Record transfer fees since 1990 and Top ten players with highest transfer values. By quickly looking at them, it is possible to observe and confirm the thesis developed by the author. Moreover, the article contains the source where the data came from, which is just raw numbers. Therefore, the organization into charts was essential to graphically show audience the correlation.
* 5
  * Most of the numbers related to the transaction fees of soccer players are the ones published by the clubs for the media. However, it is known that, in some cases, there is a clause of secrecy in these kinds of transfer negotiations, mostly because it’s normal to divide the amount of money got from selling a soccer player with the teams that formed him. Therefore, those values are not entirely accurate. In order to validate them, the only possible way would be contacting one of the two parts. As mentioned before, the article provided the source of the data, and also explained what was needed to the audience to understand the information.

#### Quality

* 4
  * The story makes a point (the rising trend of the transfer fees of soccer players), proves it giving several examples and charts, and then does a prediction for the future. Although it mentions why this trend possibly started, which is great, it does not give reasons of why this is still happening and why those numbers are becoming extremely high, with no perspective of stabilization. I think the main reason this is happening is that soccer is becoming more popular in countries with a huge market such as the US and, most recently, China. Therefore, the high values reported are mainly due to TV rights, marketing and brands sponsoring the players. In order to be more accurate and precise, it would be good if it could be included in the article how much the player and the club will earn from sponsors, TV rights, etc. for each transaction.

#### Type and Color

* 4
  * Although the graphs look good, I believe changing the color gray of the font of the numbers and labels to a darker color would be a better choice. By doing that, I believe it would make more clear to the reader to easily spot and numbers and understand the trend.

#### Creativity

* 3
  * The story was very traditional on its formatting. Under the title, there is a big photo of the Champions League 2016 final, showing Lionel Messi, the current most valuable soccer player, who is mentioned in the story. And that’s it. No more elements to make the story any different from others. However, this is not a problem.
