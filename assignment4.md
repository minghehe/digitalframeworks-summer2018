1. The database that I’m going to use is available at http://www.soccernews.com/soccer-transfers. The database contains the transfers from soccer players of the world’s major leagues, such as the Premier League (England), La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy) and Bundesliga (Germany). It is organized by the date of the transaction (since 2007-2008 season), the same and nationality of the player, the club of origin and the club of destination, as well as the value of the transfer fee.
2. Managers from soccer clubs and from soccer players would be the first to come to mind, since they are the ones that directly work with this in a daily basis. In recent years, the investment in soccer in the US has considerably increased, and several famous soccer players from European teams that are in the end of their careers have transferred to American soccer teams. Therefore, the managers of these clubs might have some valuable experience to share. Moreover, Economy, Management and Finance departments from universities might have good insight about the topic as well.
3. The main element that the data can provide is the trend of the transfer fees of the players along the years. It is expected that this tendency is an increment of the fees.
4. The news hook is first, the World Cup that just happened in Russia. Every World Cup usually “heats” the market. Usually the players that performed very well get their pass increased and are transferred to bigger teams before the season starts. This got more common specially after the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Additionally, Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the most famous soccer players in the world, transferred from Real Madrid, Spain to Juventus, Italy by €112 million, the highest transfer fee in history for a player older than 30 years old.
5. The question that will be answered is: why are the transfer fees increasing so much? It is newsworthy because every year more people are getting interested in soccer (more people watching the games on tv and stadiums, more people buying jerseys and souvenirs from the teams, more people talking about soccer in social media, etc.). Therefore, the market share for soccer increased, and companies tend to invest more money on it.
