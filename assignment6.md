1.   In last presidential election, the campaigns of the two candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary, had significant differences in spending on data (database acquisition and data analysis). Trump spent $6.3 million, while Hillary spent only $839,000 from Jan 2015 to Dec 2016.

2.  To follow up on this story, I would compare this to how the previous presidential candidates’ spending on data during 2012 and 2008 and see if there’s an up trend. I would also interview data analysts and scientists to see why there’s the trend, and what does this trend mean for the political culture in the U.S. or the world.

3. The steps that were taken to find this out were:
    1. Go to FEC website and access their database.
    2. Get both Trump and Hillary spending csv files.
    3. Use excel to investigate the two csv files.
    4. Create a pivot table to organize the dataset.
    5. Freeze panels to make the navigation easier.
    6. Using the pivot table, select to display only the row which have the description related to data (database, dataset, data acquisition, data analysis).
    7. Then, use SUBTOTAL function, choosing to show the SUM of all the rows that were previously selected in step 6.
    8. With the sums of both candidates, make the comparison.

4. Hed: Data scientists plays a bigger in presidential election than candidates themselves. 
Nut graf: Donald Trump’s spending on data in election two years ago was seven times more than Hillary’s.
