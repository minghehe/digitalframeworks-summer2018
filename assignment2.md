Here are the data points I’ll be collecting:

* Age. This is one of the most important criteria of future performance of soccer players. The reaction, running speed, running distance are all depended on an athlete’s age. 
* Position. Players have to decided into different categories in order to compare their performance. 
* Apps (the game the players played).  The data has to be representative and legit. 
* Mins (Minutes played). The data has to be representative and legit.
* Goals. This is the most direct way to weigh the value of a player. 
* Assists. This is the second most direct way to weigh the value of a player. 
* Yellow card. If a player easily get a yellow card, means he will easily put the team in the risk. 
* Red card. If a player easily get a red card, means he is not a reliable. 
* SpG(shots per game). It means the player has lower chance to score. 
* PS% (pass success percentage). It means the player has better skill. 


I will collect the data of major leagues in the world from the website:
https://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/6829/Stages/15151/PlayerStatistics/England-Premier-League-2017-2018
I am trying to contact EA Sports to give me a hint on how they do simulation with the data.
