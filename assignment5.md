1. Dataset: [link](http://www.soccernews.com/soccer-transfers/)
2. Questions:
    1. Did the transfer fees of the players, in average, increased over the years? Yes, it is possible to see an increasing tendency of the transfer fee values since 2007 until now. 
    2. Does the position of the player (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, attacker) influence on the transfer fee? Yes, it is possible to see that usually attackers and midfielders tend to have a higher value than others. However, it is also possible to notice some outliers in the data.
    3. Does the player’s age influence in the transfer fee? Although it’s not very evident, there is a slight tendency that younger players have higher value than older ones. However, the correlation is not strong.
3. Commands used on Excel to clean and visualize the data:
    1. Manually removed the transactions which had the “undisclosed”, “free” and “loan” status
    2. Freeze panels, to easily spot the headers of the columns and make comparisons
    3. Used filter, to organize the players according to their position
    4. Applied several descriptive statistics formulas to have an overall view of the data. These formulas included: AVERAGE, MEDIAN, STDEV (standard deviation), MIN, MAX. These formulas were applied on the entire dataset, as well as the sub datasets created in step 2
    5. Make graphs (scatter plots), to easily observe the tendency of the data, for the entire dataset, as well as for the sub datasets created in step 2
